Basic Truth or Dare Game.
This task is a product of group work. What is expected from us is the creation of a game that can be managed from the console with the Java programming language. We have also developed a system with various fun questions. According to this design, players will receive points according to it by randomly selecting one of the incoming questions. If the player does not answer the question, he will not earn points. This is a fun board game developed within the algorithm.
